     "details": "You can feel confident that Mayo Clinic Health System will provide a safe and secure environment for you and your baby during your stay. The birth center is a locked facility so only authorized staff and visitors can enter the space. Staff wears unique uniforms and photo nametags so you know that those caring for you are birth center staff. Staff will confirm your identity to ensure you are paired with the correct newborn and that you both receive the appropriate care. Teleneonatology is one of the many ways Mayo Clinic extends knowledge and care to more people. Using real-time video technology, neonatologists ― pediatric specialists who assist with ill newborns and premature births ― at Mayo Clinic in Rochester can partner with local providers. Teleneonatology is used primarily during newborn resuscitation or helping diagnose unusual clinical cases."
